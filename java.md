A big player on the programming field is Java, this player is here to stay and I would highly recommend you to learn it or at least the basics of it, on JejjE&#8217;s network I hope to teach you and myself something new. Here you may find some of my written Java applications &#8211; may it be plain Java, Android or even Bukkit for Minecraft.
