I"ﬁ+<p>Minecraft is best played with friends, and using Bukkit as a Minecraft server has many advantages over the vanilla server you can start through your client. First of you have about 13 000 different Bukkit plugins to customize your server as you see fit. If you‚Äôre new to Bukkit or it‚Äôs plugins it can be really hard to know what you need or even want to have on your server ‚Äì I know I was confused and had to spend many hours looking through reviews and watching YouTube videos to find what would fit me and my friends needs.</p>

<h2 id="essentials">Essentials</h2>
<!--more-->
<p>It‚Äôs name is really descriptive of what it is, this plugin is the absolute essentials every server needs ‚Äì I have not seen any server that does not have this plugin on their server. It gives you a lot of commands and features you never wanna be without.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Player made homes, and server warps.</li>
  <li>Player kits and first join kits</li>
  <li>Easy player to player teleports, including teleport requests.</li>
  <li>Full chat and nickname customization</li>
  <li>Full moderator control, with feature such as muting, jailing and temp banning</li>
  <li>Economy support, including shop signs and command costs</li>
  <li>Full permission based build control, with the ability to block certain items</li>
  <li>Core world protection, allowing you to block explosions, fire spread and other catastrophes!</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can tell by the feature list provided from the official Essentials info page at Curse.com. <a title="Essentials Bukkit Plugin" href="http://www.curse.com/bukkit-plugins/minecraft/essentials" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Download Essentials here</a> now and try it out! It would take me way to long to try to explain why this is one of the greatest plugins out there, but just a few commands that helps¬† out a lot are the <strong>/day</strong> command and the <strong>/i diamond</strong> command to easily give yourself or other players items ingame, and the fact that it has Economy support is a great way to give your players something extra to strive for.</p>

<h2 id="permissionsbukkit">PermissionsBukkit</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre going to have plugins on your Bukkit server, which you really do want to have. You will need to be able to set permissions so that your plugins work correctly, this plugin is really easy to get started with and it does not demand much from your part to setup.</p>

<h3 id="features-1">Features</h3>

  <li>Storage of users and groups in plugins/PermissionsBukkit/config.yml.</li>

<p>This is a really great plugin for server administrators, it allows you to build with the help of command line, with great tools to let you quickly create awesome creations without having to place every block, this is just a few of many applications of this plugin. But my absolute favorite feature must be the ability to save builds into schematics and move it to another server.</p>

<h2 id="craftbook">CraftBook</h2>

<p>This Bukkit plugin gives you a lot of new mechanics that you didn‚Äôt know you needed until you‚Äôve tried them, this is one of the first plugins I download when I start a new Minecraft server. My favorite mechanics that CraftBook implements are Gates that is controlled by redstone, giving you the ability to have bigger and cooler looking doors, and another of my favorites is the Bridge mechanic and is something I use a lot. This Bridge mechanic gives the players contractible bridges. When I build houses that use high ceiling, or when I‚Äôm building my house on top of a mountain ‚Äì ladders can be tedious and CraftBook has a great solution for this. This Mechanic is an Elevator where you just place two signs, one above the other, giving you the ability to quickly teleport straight up.</p>

</ul>

<p>I mentioned only a few of the many mechanics this plugin has to offer, and as you can see from the feature list from their info page ‚Äì you really need to try it out to see how amazing this plugin actually is, and you can enable or disable the mechanics you do not want to use. <a title="CraftBook Bukkit Plugin" href="http://www.curse.com/bukkit-plugins/minecraft/craftbook" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Download CraftBook</a> and put it in your plugins folder and try it out for yourself!</p>
