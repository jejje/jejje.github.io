<p>May the 18th I was told I had to prepare for a suprise. I had no idea what, I assumed we’d go eat at a restaurant.</p>

<p>This video showcases what suprised awaited me. My family and friends had planned a paintball evening for me, with me wearing a bunny suit.</p>

<p>In the video you can see a close call. In Sweden we have a saying: <em>“Nära skjuter ingen hare”</em> which roughly translates to <em>“A close call doesn’t kill a bunny”</em></p>
