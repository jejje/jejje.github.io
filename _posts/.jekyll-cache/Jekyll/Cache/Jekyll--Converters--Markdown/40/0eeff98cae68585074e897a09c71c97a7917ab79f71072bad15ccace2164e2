<p>I write this post to solve a problem I had myself with my own home network. I use the very popular PiHole as my home DNS server to remove all ads from my network. Itâ€™s great but having only one DNS server is setting up yourself for failure.</p>

<h2 id="raspberry-pi-zero-w">Raspberry Pi Zero W</h2>
<p>PiHole is very efficient and can be run by almost any Raspberry Pi model you might have. I bought two<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/"> Raspberry Pi Zero W </a> which has only 512mb RAM and a single core, but that is enough for a small home network.</p>

<p>Pi Zero W is really cheap, low powered and quiet. It doesnâ€™t have Ethernet but this model of the Pi has Wifi.</p>

<p>With only one PiHole DNS server I had Internet trouble everytime I rebooted the server. As you might know, if DNS fails the whole Internet fails. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s good that I bought two!</p>
