<h2 id="1-linus-torvalds">1. Linus Torvalds</h2>

What started off as a hobby has become the operating system of choice for data centers, supercomputers, and server farms worldwide. Linus is now a mogul of the operating system world, with his Linux system used around the world from personal computers to major corporations. Most of the webpages that you visit are hosted on servers with Linux based operating systems like.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Debian</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.centos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CentOS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Linux kernel has been used for other operating systems, such as GNU, and has in recent times become known as Android and Chrome OS systems. The scope of the Linux world is vast, with many home operating systems working from the Linux kernel that Linus developed, making him one of the most influential programmers in the world.</p>

<p>Linus is also very well known for not playing nicely with others. He has publicly rebuffed questions that he has thought are trivial and seems to not care if people like him personally or not. Though this has put off some in the Linux community, the power of his operating system is such that it will be a favorite with or without Linusâ€™ antics.</p>

Berners-Lee is the creator of hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), or the thing that the whole internet is based on, in 1989. Without his influence we wouldnâ€™t have been able to make the Internet as widely used as it is today.</p>

<p>Berners-Lee is also the director of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">World Wide Web Consortium (WC3)</a>, which oversees the development of the internet worldwide, as well as being a director for the Wed Science Research Initiative, the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation, and a senior research and holder of the Founders Chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p>

<p>More recently, Berners-Lee has been advocating for a not-for-profit organisation, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_for_Affordable_Internet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alliance of Affordable Internet</a>, to get internet access more affordable for everyone in the world. His mission is backed by the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.</p>

He was also, until recently, the CEO of Mozilla, the company that runs the Firefox web browser. Eich started his career at Silicon Graphics, working on network code and operating systems. In 1995 he started work at Netscape Communications Corporation and was commissioned to create a programming language.</p>

<p>This initial project was called Mocha, before it was renamed to LiveScript, and then again to <strong>JaveScript</strong>. Which has influenced the way we can interact with web content, and today almost all website uses Javascript in one way or another. In 1998, Eich co-founded the Mozilla project and worked there as the chief technical officer until he was promoted to chief executive officer in 2014.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him, in the same year he was implicated in a scandal after giving a personal donation to a campaign that was seeking ban gay marriage. Eich stepped down from CEO the same year that he was appointed.</p>
