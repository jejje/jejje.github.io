It was not too long ago Windows XP was buried, it was not too long ago that Windows 8 was released and the metro made everyone feel like they had no idea what they were doing in front of their PC&#8217;s &#8211; and we&#8217;re already on our way to Windows 10 (yes, they skipped 9).

## Windows 10 home won&#8217;t allow you to disable updates

If you&#8217;re going to be one of many other users who are going to choose the Windows 10 Home version, and this edition of <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/219166/you-won%E2%80%99t-be-able-to-disable-or-delay-windows-updates-on-windows-10-home/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Windows is not going to allow you to disable</a> or decide when your Windows updates &#8211; you will need the **Pro** or the **Enterprise** version. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Well that depends&#8230; If you&#8217;re kind of tech savvy you will feel robbed of the decision but if you&#8217;re an every day user it can actually save your day by keeping your Windows up to date all the time and get those security updates. Well I know which version I&#8217;m getting when it&#8217;s time to switch.

## Sneak peak into Windows 10

I was curios about the new operation system so I <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">downloaded the free preview ISO of Windows 10 from Microsoft</a> and installed it on a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Virtual Machine in Virtualbox</a>, it is not yet recommended to replace it so I found this to be a great option. I took a look around to see some of the differences and the feel of it, and at first IÂ  even had big troubles finding the Updates part in the Control Panel until I later found out a separate settings panel, check out my Youtube video below to get a sneak peak.
