<p>Have you found a great Android game that you really enjoy playing, are you finding the game to be hard to play on your phone and you might not have access to an Android Tablet? Then you might would like to try out BlueStacks for Windows and Mac, I use it to p lay a few games on my PC.

<p>It’s easy to get started and first you’ll need to <a title="Download Android Emulator to play Android Games on your Computer from BlueStacks" href="http://www.bluestacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">visit BlueStacks webpage and dowload the installer <em>(~251mb)</em></a>, downloading this will allow you to play Android Games on your computer and even try out <a title="Google's Play Store for Android" href="https://play.google.com/store" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">other apps from the Play Store</a>.

<p>And with the new Fallout Shelter Halloween update a lot of nice new features and assets come out, and I really suggest you try it out! With the update the possibility to add your save to the cloud and you can play on multiple devices like your phone, tablet and BlueStacks at the <em>same</em> time.</p>

<p>Check out my YouTube video when I play Fallout Shelter on Windows, with the ability to use a mouse instead of the tip of your finger. And when I’m finished I can download the new cloud save to my Android phone!</p>
